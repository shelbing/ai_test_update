# A Fun Bear Adventure

Once upon a time, there was a bear named Bruno. Bruno was a very special bear because he loved to roller-skate. One day, while rolling through the woods, he noticed that his bear cake was missing. "Oh no!", exclaimed Bruno, "How can I continue without my delicious cake?"

Bruno decided to ask his friends for help. The first one he met was a squirrel named Erwin. Erwin said: "Why does a bear like you leave the house without his cake? Come on, let's find it!"

Together, they rolled on and met an old white owl. The owl laughed and said: "Bruno, your cake is always found in your heart." Bruno scratched his head. What did the owl mean?

In the end, Bruno naturally found his cake again - it was under a green bush all along. From then on, Bruno decided never to take his eyes off his cake again, and the friends celebrated with a green picnic in the woods.

## A Day Full of Laughter

This day went down in bear history as "The Day of the Lost Cake," and every animal in the forest learned that good friends and a delicious cake are the best things in life.
